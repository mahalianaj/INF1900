*
*Description: The houseSequence class defines the sequence of actions for the robot to take in order to navigate 
* the "house" section of the circuit. The various functions allow for the adaptable movement of the
* robot through detection of distance and lines, as well as making use of the appropriate movement
* speeds and delays. The Start() function is the only one the user needs to call to utilize this class,
* the rest being automatically triggered in according circumstances.
