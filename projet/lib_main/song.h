*Description: Description: The Song class allows the piezo to operate. Initializing an object of this class
* initializes all the ports to which the piezo should be connected (PB2-PB3), as well as the timer 0
* of the ATmega324PA in CTC mode. There is a function which converts the respective note numbers into MIDI frequencies,
* and another function which allows a note to be played continuously.
