*Description: This class manages communication between the memory and the PC via RS232, i.e., the exchange of messages in binary
* or ASCII characters. The class's initialization method defines the configuration of the ports through which the
* exchange takes place, as well as the frame speed and format. The transmission method manages the exchange and
* the content of the message itself.
