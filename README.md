# INF1900 Final Project ‚Äì First Year Software Engineering project

This repository contains the code and resources for the final project of the INF1900 course at Polytechnique Montr√©al.

## üîç Overview

The goal of the project is to design and program a small autonomous robot using an AVR microcontroller. The robot must:

- Follow a black line on a 4x8 ft table.
- Detect and avoid obstacles placed along the path.
- React to instructions (turn left or right) given via buttons before starting.
- Successfully complete a predefined course with intersections and decision points.

This project brings together skills in embedded programming (C/C++), sensor integration, motor control, and system design.
